    <p>In Chile, sopaipillas (or sopaipas) are known to have been eaten at least since 1726. 
    Although traditional Chilean sopaipillas made in central Chile include cooked ground pumpkin in their dough, 
    this is typically not the case in the south</p>
    <p>Depending if they are served as a pastry or bread Chilean sopaipillas are traditionally served with either <strong>pebre</strong> 
        (a sauce of chili pepper, onion, garlic and coriander) or boiled in <strong><em>chancaca</em> sauce</strong> 
        (a homemade hot syrup cooked with panela, orange peel and cinnamon, and then they are called <em>sopaipillas pasadas</em>). </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>9 ounces zapallo squash</li>
                <li>4 <small>1/4</small> cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>10 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 cups canola oil for pan-frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel, seed, and cut zapallo into chunks. Place in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                Cook until zapallo is soft and easily pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl, and set aside. Stir together squash and melted butter. 
                Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until blended. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and satiny, 
                adding a little more flour if necessary. Cover dough with a towel and allow to rest 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick, and cut into 3-inch diameter circles. Poke each circle a few times with a fork to make holes and prevent rising.</li>
                <li>Pour oil into a large, deep skillet and heat over medium-high heat until hot, 385 degrees F (195 degrees C). 
                Place several of the dough circles into hot oil; cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cook remainder of dough circles in batches.</li>
