    <p>Cacio e pepe is a pasta dish typical of the <strong>Lazio region of Italy</strong>. 
    The dish contains <em>grated pecorino romano and black pepper</em> with tonnarelli or spaghetti.
    A common story is that shepherds from the pastoral communities of Lazio, Abruzzo, Tuscany, 
    and Umbria created cacio e pepe in the 18th or 19th century. </p>
