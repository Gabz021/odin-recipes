    <p>An arepa is a <strong>round, unleavened cake or patty </strong> made from ground maize (corn) 
    that is a staple food in Venezuela and Colombia, eaten with meals or as a snack. 
    They can be <em>grilled, baked, or fried</em> and are often split open and filled with a variety 
    of ingredients like cheese, butter, avocado, beans, or meat, resembling a savory sandwich or bread. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 <small>1/2</small> cups lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal</li>
                <li><small>1/4</small> cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
                <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
                Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
                <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
